# Window Functions: Used for performing calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.
# Joins: Employed to combine data from multiple tables based on a related column between them.
# Aggregate Functions: Utilized for computing a single result from a set of multiple rows.
# Subqueries: Employed to nest one SQL query within another SQL query.
